Variant heterozygous, co-occurs in trans with c.629del (p.Tyr210Leufs*14). Variants confirmed in trans via parental testing. No alternate cause for disease identified, 407 gene immunodeficiency panel ordered which included all known SCID genes. The co-occurring variant c.629del (p.Tyr210Leufs*14) is absent from gnomAD (PM2) and is a frameshift variant occurring in exon 8 out of 14 (PVS1 - frameshift variant predicted to undergo NMD in a LOF gene). PM2 + PVS1 alone is enough to classify c.629del (p.Tyr210Leufs*14) as LP, but we also additionally can apply PP4 to the variant as well. Therefore, the co-occurring variant is at least LP and is confirmed in trans with our variant in this patient. This is worth 1 point under SVI recommendation for PM3. 2) This variant identified in 1 while\/Caucasian patient in PMID: 36546626 (ART007) meeting PP4 criteria. Variant co-occurs with Deletion (Exons 1-5). Inclusion criteria for cohort reported in this paper included that patient must have mutation of both alleles, therefore the variants are in trans. Deletion (Exons 1-5) has not yet been interpreted by the SCID VCEP, but this variant would be at least LP since it is a CNV that deletes the first 5 exons of the gene, which would include the initiator codon and several missense variants located in this region have been classified as LP or P by the SCID VCEP (p.Ile16Thr and p.Thr65Ile for example).
